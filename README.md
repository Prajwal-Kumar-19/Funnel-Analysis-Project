# 🚀 Funnel-Analysis-Project

Funnel Analysis** 🍽️  
This project presents a thorough **funnel analysis** of one of India’s leading food e-commerce platforms. By leveraging real data, this analysis breaks down user behavior at every stage of the funnel—from browsing to placing orders. The aim of this study was to uncover patterns, trends, and potential bottlenecks that impact order performance and user conversions. 📊

### 🔍 **Scope of the Project**
The analysis utilized three core data sheets:
1. **Session Details**: This data includes session counts over time—covering listing sessions, menu sessions, cart sessions, payment sessions, and order sessions, enabling us to track user flow through each stage of the platform.
2. **Channel-wise Traffic**: This sheet provides insights into how traffic varies across different channels (such as direct, referral, search, etc.), breaking it down into daily sessions.
3. **Supporting Data**: Additional context and metrics that help complete the picture, including restaurant counts and order volumes. 

### 📊 **Key Areas of Analysis**
- **Session Trends**  
  We looked at the number of sessions across various stages of the funnel, identifying high-traffic days, weekend surges, and periods of increased or decreased user activity. This analysis allowed us to pinpoint significant trends in user engagement.
  
- **Traffic Fluctuations**:  
  Using channel-specific data, we identified key sources of traffic. We compared traffic patterns week over week to understand if certain channels were driving more users or if any channels showed a significant drop-off. This helped us isolate any traffic-related issues that might affect company's overall performance. 
  
- **Conversion Rates**:  
  The project breaks down **overall conversion** across the user journey into specific segments:
  - **L2M** (Listings to Menu views)
  - **M2C** (Menu to Cart conversions)
  - **C2P** (Cart to Payment conversions)
  - **P2O** (Payment to Order completions)  

  By examining each step, we identified which stage experiences the most drop-offs and where Swiggy could potentially optimize to boost overall conversions. 📈

### 🔑 **Insights and Findings**:
- **Significant Spikes and Drops**:  
  The analysis revealed several patterns, including notable spikes in orders during weekends and promotional periods. We also found substantial drops during certain weekdays, helping to define what could be considered a “high” (20%+ increase) or “low” (20%+ decrease).
  
- **Traffic Source Insights**:  
  By comparing traffic across different channels, we were able to spot which ones were underperforming or overperforming, highlighting opportunities to improve traffic acquisition strategies.
  
- **Conversion Analysis**:  
  The funnel conversion rates (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O) were particularly insightful in understanding user drop-offs at critical stages. We identified specific points where company could focus on improving user retention, such as optimizing the transition from **Menu to Cart** or reducing the friction in the **Cart to Payment** process.

### 📂 **Methodology**:
- **Excel** was used extensively for data analysis, processing, and visualization. From formatting, creating pivot tables and charts to calculating conversion metrics, Excel allowed us to uncover actionable insights from the data.
- The analysis and insights were thoroughly documented in a **Word report**, where each observation was supported with data visuals and detailed explanations.
